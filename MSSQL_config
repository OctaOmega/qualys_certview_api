Create the SQL table
If your sheet has columns like SerialNumber, CommonName, CertificateStatus, create a table like:

CREATE TABLE dbo.CertInventory (
  SerialNumber     NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  CommonName       NVARCHAR(255) NULL,
  CertificateStatus NVARCHAR(50) NULL
);

Option A (most common): Import using SSMS “Import Data”
Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) → connect to your database
Right-click the database → Tasks → Import Data…
Data source: Microsoft Excel
Pick the file, select the sheet (e.g., Sheet1$)
Destination: SQL Server Native Client / Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server (your server/db)
Choose Copy data from one or more tables

Either:
Pick an existing table (like dbo.CertInventory), or
Let the wizard create a new table (then verify data types)

Run the import


Notes:
Ensure the first row in Excel is headers.
If SerialNumber has leading zeros, make it a text column in Excel first (or it may get changed).

Option B (recommended for repeatable/clean imports): Save as CSV + BULK INSERT
Save Excel as CSV (UTF-8) (e.g., certs.csv)
Put the CSV on the SQL Server machine (or a path SQL Server service can access)

Run:

BULK INSERT dbo.CertInventory
FROM 'C:\imports\certs.csv'
WITH (
  FIRSTROW = 2,
  FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
  ROWTERMINATOR = '0x0a',
  CODEPAGE = '65001',
  TABLOCK
);


Option C: Use SSIS (best for enterprise pipelines)

Use SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) → build an SSIS package:
Excel Source → Data Conversion/Cleansing → SQL Server Destination.
Common issues to watch
Excel mixed data types (some blanks/some text) can import as NULLs. CSV import is often more stable.
Trailing spaces / hidden characters: you may want to LTRIM(RTRIM()) after import.
Duplicates: add a unique constraint on SerialNumber if required.
